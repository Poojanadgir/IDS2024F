1. A scientific inference is made by taking the reality and observational data into consideration. There are three steps to occur to a scientific inference- Caliberation, validation and prediction scenarios.  
2. The three pillars of science are: Experiment, Theory, computaional+data  
3.Three major applications of the third pillar- predictive computing, numerical stimulation, machine learning and deep learning.
4. Two types of logical reasoning refers to deductive and plausible reasoning. deductive= A=> the lights are off; B=> the lights are on (in these statements, the lights are off can be true, but if the statement is false, it simply means that the lights are on)
  - Plausible reasoning- a=> I water the plants, b=> They appear to thrive (watering the plants seems to help them grow better, therefore, is benificial for their health)
5. Data and reality are different because data is influenced by how a person perceives it whereas, reality is the natural phenomenon. Yes we can observe reality, but it is differentially observed by every person.
6. 
7. no, logical implication cannot be the same as physical causation. Ex: A-It is below freezing temperature; B=The water is frozen. Yes, while A=>B can be true but it can also be possible that the water was frozen in other ways rather than the environmental temperature.  
8. Boolean algebra was named after George Boole(1854).

11. When two Boolean propositions are said to be equal, they denote equal truth value.
12. When you add two propositions that compliment each other, at least one of the statement is said to be true. 
13. When you multiply two propositions that complement each other, It means both, statements A and B are true or false. For Ex. a= I will be at school today, b= you will be at school today. when you add them; Both you and I will be at school today.

15. The tiniest unit of information is called a bit.
16. No, a completely empty universe would not contain any information.
17.  4 Bits of storage can be represented with up to 16 possibilities.
18.  12 possibilities can be represented in this situation.
