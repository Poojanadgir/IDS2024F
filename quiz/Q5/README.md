1. Express the mathematical meaning of π(A|B) .  
- This expression can be read as pi, A given B. Here, 'π' is pi, and '|' is given.  

2. Name four major historical definitions of Probability.  
- There are four types of probability. **classical probability**; **Bayesian probability**; **frequentist probability**; **PRopensity probability**.  

3. Which school(s) of thought define probability as the degree of belief?  
- Classical probability.  

4. Which school(s) of thought define probability as the relative frequency of occurrence?  
- frequentist probabilty.  

5. Which probability definition(s), among those we have discussed in class, allow defining the Probability of the existence of God? Why?  
- Classical/ Bayesian probability.  

6. Is Bayesian Inference a subset of the Frequentist Inference methods? Why?  
- No, Bayesian Inference is not a subset of frequentist methods. Because, Bayesian traets parameters as random and the latter treats parameters as fixed.  

7. Which inference methodology allows the inclusion of expert knowledge in data analysis and decision-making?  
- Classical and Bayesian.  

8. Why is Bayesian Probability Theory more popular among physicists and engineers and Frequentist Probability Theory more popular among Biologists and Social Scientists?  
(Hint: Recall the example we discussed in class experiments that can never be repeated.)  
- This is because the Bayesian probability theory is based on degree of beliefe whereas the frequenbtist is based on frequency of occurance.  

9. When did the first modern definition of Probability appear in history?  
- The 1700s.  

10. What kinds of uncertainty exist in our experiments?  
- Epistemic and aleatoric.  

11. Suppose there is a donkey outside the classroom. I ask you what you observe and tell me what you see. You tell me that you see a horse. What kind of uncertainty is involved in your observation?  
- This is epistemic uncertainty. 

12. what are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
- All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features as aesthetics. Few examples of aesthetics are; **position, shape, size, color**.  

13. Name the two major classes of aesthetics.  
- Two amjor classes of aesthetics are **Continuous and discrete**.  

14. What is the difference between factors and levels?  
- Variables holding qualitative data are *factors*, and the different categories are called *levels*.   

15. Name the two major types of data and provide an example for each category.  
- There are two types of data- continuous and discrete. Under that, the two main types of data are, qualitative(categorical)- *color of a shirt* and quantitaive data(numerical)- *hieght of a person*  

16. What is the common name for variables holding data?  
- Variables holding qualitative data are factors.  

17. Provide examples of ordered and unordered data.          
- Ordered: *education level, days of the week*; Unordered: *colors, countries*.    

18. Name four different color scales and explain their most appropriate usage.  
- i) qualitative color scale- a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map or different manufacturers of a certain product.
ii) Sequential color scale- used to represent data values, such as income, temperature, or speed.
iii) Diverging color scale- the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint.
iv) Accent color scales- an effective tool to highlight specific elements in the data.  

19. Professional Data Scientists tend to avoid 3D plots in their visualizations. Why?  
- This is because it is not the most ideal way to portray/ represent a peice of information or the data. 3D Plots are avoided as it might tend to misleading interpretation of the data.   

20. Recall our class discussions on the kinds of data, for example, numerical vs. categorical. Describe an example dataset that could be classified as either numerical or categorical, depending on how it is represented.  
- Numerical- *age, hight, temperature, weight* ; Categorical- *Hair color; location)  

21. Is color a categorical/unordered or quantitative/ordered aesthetics?    
- Color is categorical and unordered aesthetic.  

22. The combination of a set of position scales and their relative geometric arrangement is called a coordinate system. Coordinate systems allow us to assign unique IDs (a set of numbers called coordinates) to unique location on a map (think of Google map pins, for example).    
When we deal with data, these unique IDs are often assumed to be data values that we want to visualize and each coordinate axis corresponds to a single data attribute.  
Given this information, which one of the following three coordinates are valid and can be used to represent data or visualize the data attribute values?  
(Hint: Recall that the sole criterion for the validity of coordinates is the ability to assign unique set of numbers (data values) to unique points in the coordinates space (visualization space).)  
- The black colored grid is the most valid graph to show/ represent data, because it is the most accurate way to represent data.

23. The most effective color pallete is the first one as this one is widely acceptable and the colors are visible from a distance to to their high wavelength.

24. i) San Diego
  ii) Chicago
  iii) San Diego
  iv) San Diego

25. a. Qualitative color scale
  b. sequential color scale
  c. Diverging color scale
  d. accent color scale

26. Polar coordinates can be useful for data of a periodic nature, such that data values at one end of the scale can be logically
joined to data values at the other end.

27. Accent color scale.

28. The graph/ visualization is not labelled well- No header for the graph. the diagonal representation of the movie names makes it ugly. 

29. a. Increase.
    b. 3 degrees hotter.
