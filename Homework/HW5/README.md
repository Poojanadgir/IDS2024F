2. Three fundamental desiderata of probability theory are:  
(I) Degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers.    
(II) Qualitative correspondence with common sense.     
(III) Consistency.  

3. All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features as aesthetics. Few operations That can appear in data visualization are: color, shape, size, line width, line type.  

4. All aesthetics fall into one of two groups: Those that can represent continuous data and those that cannot; Continuous and discrete.  

5. There are two types of data- continuous and discrete. Under that, the two main types of data are, qualitative(categorical)- *color of a shirt* and quantitaive data(numerical)- *hieght of a person*  

6. common name for variables holding data is called **factors**.    

7.  Ordered: *education level, *; Unordered:*colors, countries*    

8.  Month- Qulaitative/ Categorical  
    Day- Ordered  
    Location- Qualitative  
    Station ID- Discrete  
    Temperature- Numerical  

9. Coordinate system axes.  

10. Plotting economic data; Scientific data with large dynamic ranges.  

11. The black colored grid is the most valid graph to show/ represent data.  

12. i) qualitative color scale-  a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map or different manufacturers of a certain product.  
ii) Sequential color scale- used to represent data values, such as income, temperature, or speed.    
iii) Diverging color scale- the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint.      
iv) Accent color scales- an effective tool to highlight specific elements in the data.  

13. This visualization lacks proper labelling and context. This makes it difficult to interpret the given visualization. (The y-axis values are not labelled correctly, Lack of title and description)  

14. The second one, because 5%-8% of humans are color blind, and purple-green is a viable alternative.

16. Classical probability; Bayesian Probability; Frequentist probability; Propensity probability.  

17. Two- Frog and Horse.  

18. we can move the bottom left match stick to make it 9 and place i in the middle of the 0 to make it 8. That way 9+3-4=8.
