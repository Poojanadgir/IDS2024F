1. Three pillars of science are experiment, observation and theory.
2. 
3. The two types of scientific reasoning in science are;  
a. plausible reasoning: ex. A= I water the plants, B= The appear to thrive (wtaering the plant seems to help them grow better. Therefore, watering plants is likely benificial for their health)  
b. deductive reasoning: Ex. A= All mammals are warm blooded animals, B= A dolphin is a mammal (In this example, statement A is followed by a true logic in sentence B, which makes both sentences true.)  
4. Reality is the natural phenomenon whereas, observational data refers to data that can be influenced by someone's perspective.
5. Descriptive, Explainatory and predictive.
6. Logical proposition is a statement that can be true or false, but not both.
7. No, a logical proposition cannot be true and false simultaneously. This is because if there is a statement that is true, there is a statement that contradicts the statement. For example; *the light is on*- If the light is actually on, this proposition is true but if its off, the proposition is false.
