1. Three pillars of science are experiment, observation and theory.
2. Prediction scenario, Validation scenario, caliberation scenario
3. The two types of scientific reasoning in science are;  
a. plausible reasoning: ex. A= I water the plants, B= The appear to thrive (wtaering the plant seems to help them grow better. Therefore, watering plants is likely benificial for their health)  
b. deductive reasoning: Ex. A= All mammals are warm blooded animals, B= A dolphin is a mammal (In this example, statement A is followed by a true logic in sentence B, which makes both sentences true.)  
4. Reality is the natural phenomenon whereas, observational data refers to data that can be influenced by someone's perspective.
5. Descriptive, Explainatory and predictive.
6. Logical proposition is a statement that can be true or false, but not both.
7. No, a logical proposition cannot be true and false simultaneously. This is because if there is a statement that is true, there is a statement that contradicts the statement. For example; *the light is on*- If the light is actually on, this proposition is true but if its off, the proposition is false.
8. No, A⇒B does'nt necessitate B⇒A. For example-A: It is raining; B: The ground is wet. The statement A⇒B is true becuase the rain causes the ground to be wet. Whereas, the statement B⇒A does not make sense (if the ground is wet it is raining.).

12. A=> It is below freezing  
    B=> Water is frozen  
    Logically, A=> B can be true, but there can be a possiblity that the water was frozen earlier in the freezer.  
13. Assuming that statement A is that the burgler is stealing goods and crawling out of the broken window, and statement B being the man is dishonest. We can say that A=>B is true (the man is stealing, hence, he is dishonest) but we cannot say that B=>A is true (it cannot be that the man is dishonest because he stole, a person can be dishonest for good reasons.)  
14. a. The tiniest unit of information is a bit.
    b. Because, it provides the simplest possible distinction.
    It wouldn't be easy to tell the coordinates of where you are at without a reference point. In order to find this out we need something external to compare your position and motion against.
    c. 1. one box, 2 possiblities.
       2. two boxes, 2 possibilities.
       3. three boxes, 8 possiblities.
