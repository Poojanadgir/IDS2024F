1. What is the difference between observational data and reality (truth)?  
   Observational data is what we perceive of nature. Reality is what we will never know because it is always obfuscated
   with our biases and measurement uncertainties.  

2. What are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
   All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features as aesthetics. Few aesthetics that appear
   in data visualization are, 1.)position, 2.)Shape, 3.)size, 4.)color, 5.)line width etc.  

3. Consider the following color palettes. Which one is more appropriate for effective visualization communications with humans? Why?  
   The purple green is a viable alternative for effective visualization because 5%-8% of humans are color blind.  

4. Which classes of color scales the following color-mappings belong to? Very briefly describe the primary use case of each class.  
   a.) *qualitative color scale*: a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map or different manufacturers of a certain product.  
   b.) *sequential color scale*: can be used to represent values like income, temperature or speed.  
   c.) *Diverging color scale*- the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint is represented using this scale.  
   d.) *accent scales*- an effective tool to highlight specific elements in the data.  

5. Which one(s) of the following statements are valid or invalid. Why?  
This person is breathing. = This person is inhaling and exhaling. *valid*  
This person is breathing. ≡ This person is inhaling and exhaling. *valid*  
This person is conscious. ≡ This person is breathing. *Invalid*  
This person is conscious. = This person is breathing. *Invalid*  
It is rainy. ≡ The sky is cloudy. *Invalid*  
It is rainy. = The sky is cloudy. *Invalid*  

6. Name the three pillars of science.  
   The three pillars of science are- Experiment, Theory, Computation.  

7. Is logical implication the same as physical causation? Explain with a real-world example.  
   logical implication and physical causation are NOT the same. EG- If it rains at 10 am, it is not because it was cloudy at 9.45 am. It can be cloudy and not rain
   as well.  

8. a. Is this visually a good fit in your opinion? Why?-  
   No, i dont think this data is visually a good fit because it doesn't show accurate data and is unorganised and scattered.   

b. What type of uncertainty dominates this dataset in the early years (before 1850)?  
   epistemic- the data before 1850 is not accurate because the people didn't have the right sources to know the correct temperature.  

c. Could this dataset be classified as timeseries data? Why?  
   Yes, because- A time series is a series of observations that are sequentially ordered. Typically, this order is determined by the times of observations.  

d. We can see a slight rise in temperature anomaly around 1940s, followed by a slight temporary decline in temperature anomaly? What’s the likely reason for the observed trend around this time?  

9. Can we represent probability as we define in science using integer numbers?  
   No, Probability is real number whose range must be either [0,1] or [1,+infinity]  

10. What are the consistency criteria required to define probability?  
    (I) If a conclusion can be reasoned out in more than one way, then every possible way must lead to the same result.  
    (II) We must always consider all the evidence relevant to a question. We should not arbitrarily ignore some information, basing the conclusions only on what 
         remains.  
    (III) We must always represent equivalent states of knowledge by equivalent plausibility assignments.  

11. What is the equivalent of the following binary numbers 1, 01, and 10 in decimal representation?  
    1=> 1  
    10=> 2  
    01=> 1  

12. Are real numbers representable in modern digital computers? Explain you answer.  
    No, Real numbers are not representable in modern computers because the computer comprehends the binary decimals better that the other.  

13. 

14. GitHub- an Internet hosting service, works exclusively for projects that are indexed using Git VCS.  
    Git- Git is a DVCS that developed between the Linux kernel developing community and a proprietary VCS software company that maintained and 
         indexed Linux kernel development. Git is designed with the following goals in mind:  
        - Speed.  
        - Simple design.  
        - Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches). Fully distributed.  
        - Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)  

15. Which school(s) of probability theory allow incorporation of expert (prior) knowledge in scientific inference?  
    Bayesian and Classical probability.  

16. When data is scarce, which school of probability theory is the most useful for scientific inference?  
    Classical probability.  

17. Which school of thought in Probability Theory cannot define or discuss the probability of existence of God? Why?  
    Frequentist probaility. This is beacuse it contains abundant data and this probability leans more towards that of scientific and logical inference.  

18. What is wrong in the following visualization?  
    The units by which the density is measured is not labelled.  

19. Why is everything represented by integers in computers?  
    Because the 1/0 (or) on/ off version of the computer is better for the circuits of the computer.
  
20. Name an ancestor programming language of C.
   - B

21. Name the first high-level programming language in computer history.
    The thrid generation programming languages are the high level programming languages. The first one is called fortran.

24. The two types of reasoning in Science: Deductive and plausible reasoning.
    deductive- A≡ I am dead; B≡ i am not breathing.  
    plausible- A ≡ it will start to rain by 10 am at the latest;  
               B ≡ the sky will become cloudy before 10 am

25. What does it mean if two Boolean propositions are equal?
    two propositions with the same truth value are equally plausible.

27. The given symbol,"|" means **given**. so when you say  A|B, it means A given B.

28. The value of the summation is 1665. I used the summation formula to derive this answer.

32. There are two types of fundamental und=certainties- Epistemic and aleatoric. intrinsic is that data that is in order. Like good, excellent, poor, bad.
